# vue-custom-events-from-dynamic-components

This repo was created to demonstrate a problem with listening to custom events from dynamic components in a Vue app. See the [related question on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53966375/vue-vm-on-callback-not-working-in-parent-when-event-is-emitted-from-dynamic).

This quick and dirty prototype was built using vue cli 3, and recreates a problem I'm having in my [concats app](https://github.com/brianzelip/concats).
